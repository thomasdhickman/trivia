# Trivia
Trivia app built by a group of Troy area middle schoolers!

The goal of this project was to teach the group some of the basics of Android development and Java, including: 
- Activities
- Intents
- Bundles
- Android views
- Java Objects
- Conditional Logic
- Android Manifest

After a few hours of guiding the students through starting a new app, building their first activity, including it in their manifest, implementing and describing the behavior of the #onCreate(Bundle) lifecycle method, tying views to Java Objects via the #findViewById(int) method, and letting them play around with changing background colors and text, we put their hard work to the test by building this app together, identifying issues along the way and building it with their new knowledge of Android development. 
 
The final component of the lesson is for the students to individually devise a scoring system for the trivia game and display the user's score on the final page.
